      The <a>Web of Things</a> (WoT) provides layered interoperability between <a>Things</a> by using the <a>WoT Interface</a>s.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification describes a programming interface representing the <a>WoT Interface</a> that allows scripts run on a <a>Thing</a> to discover and consume (retrieve) other <a>Thing</a>s and to expose <a>Things</a> characterized by <a> WoT Interactions</a>, i.e. <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a> and <a>Events</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scripting is an optional "convenience" building block in WoT and it is typically used in gateways that are able to run a <a>WoT Runtime</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/tree/master/applications/script-manager">script management</a>, providing a convenient way to extend WoT support to new types of endpoints and implement WoT applications like <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/tree/master/applications/thing-directory">Thing Directory</a>.

  <section id="introduction"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The overall WoT concepts are described in the [WoT Architecture](https://w3c.github.io/wot-architecture/) document.
      The Web of Things is made of entities (<a>Thing</a>s) that can describe their capabilities in a machine-interpretable format, the <a>Thing Description</a> (TD) and expose these capabilities through the <a>WoT Interface</a>. Support for scripting is optional for WoT devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      By <a>consuming a TD</a>, a client <a>Thing</a> creates a runtime resource model that allows accessing the <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a> and <a>Events</a> exposed by the server <a>Thing</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exposing a <a>Thing</a> requires defining a <a>Thing Description</a> (TD) and instantiating a software stack needed to serve requests for accessing the exposed <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a> and <a>Events</a>. This specification describes how to expose and consume <a>Thing</a>s by a script.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Typically scripts are meant to be used on devices able to provide resources (with a <a>WoT interface</a>) for managing (installing, updating, running) scripts, such as bridges or gateways that expose and control simpler devices as WoT <a>Thing</a>s.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      This specification does not make assumptions on how the <a>WoT Runtime</a> handles and runs scripts, including single or multiple tenancy, script deployment and lifecycle management. The API already supports the generic mechanisms that make it possible to implement script management, for instance by exposing a manager <a>Thing</a> whose <a>Actions</a> (action handlers) implement script lifecycle management operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an introduction on how scripts could be used in <a>Web of Things</a>, check the [Primer](https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/primer) document. For some background on API design decisions check the [Rationale](https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/rationale) document.

    <h2>The <dfn>WoT</dfn> object</h2>
    <p>The WoT object is the API entry point and it is exposed by an implementation of the <a>WoT Runtime</a>. The <dfn>WoT object</dfn> does not expose properties, only methods for discovering, consuming and exposing a <a>Thing</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
       Browser implementations SHOULD use a namespace object such as `wot`, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)-like runtimes MAY provide the API object through the [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) or [`import`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-imports) mechanism.

    <section> <h3>The <dfn>discover()</dfn> method</h3>
      <p>
        Starts the discovery process that will provide <code><a>ConsumedThing</a></code> objects that match the optional argument <code><a>ThingFilter</a></code>. When the argument is not provided, starts the widest discovery the <a>Thing Description</a> and <a>Protocol Bindings</a> allow and support.
        Returns an [<code>Observable</code>](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable) object that can be subscribed to and unsubscribed from.

      <section data-dfn-for="ThingFilter">
        <h4>The <dfn>ThingFilter</dfn> dictionary</h4>
        <p>
          The <a>ThingFilter</a> dictionary that represents the constraints for discovering <a>Thing</a>s as key-value pairs.

          The <dfn>method</dfn> property represents the discovery type that should be used in the discovery process. The possible values are defined by the <code><a>DiscoveryMethod</a></code> enumeration that can be extended by string values defined by solutions (with no guarantee of interoperability).
        </p>
        <p class="ednote">
          The <a>DiscoveryMethod</a> enumeration can be extended by the <a>Thing Description</a> with values that are not specified here. This extensibility of <a>DiscoveryMethod</a> by proprietary or private methods is a working assumption until consensus is formed and may be removed later.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>url</dfn> property represents additional information for the discovery method, such as the URL of the target entity serving the discovery request, such as a <a>Thing Directory</a> or a Thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>query</dfn> property represents a query string accepted by the implementation, for instance a SPARQL query.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <dfn>constraints</dfn> property represents additional information for the discovery method in the form of a list of sets of property-value pairs (dictionaries). The list elements (dictionaries) are in OR relationship, and within a constraint dictionary the key-value pairs are in AND relationship. Implementations SHOULD make the following mapping from the constraint dictionaries to <a>SemanticAnnotations</a>: for each property-value pair in a constraint dictionary,
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each property name in the constraint dictionary SHOULD match the either the  `name` property of a defined <a>SemanticType</a> on the target <a>Thing</a> object, or the name of a <a>Property</a> on the target <a>Thing</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              When the name matches, the values are compared. If the values match, the constraint is matched.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="ednote">
          Constraints are experimental feature, implementations are not required to support them.
        </p>
        <p class="ednote">
          Semantic annotations need revisiting in order to simplify their representation. In the [[WOT-TD]] specification they represent the `@type` construct. At the moment only `@context`, `@type` and `@id` constructs are used in the <a>TD</a>.

        Note that canceling a discovery (through `unsubscribe()`) may not be successful in all cases, for instance when discovery is based on open ended broadcast requests.

Also, a discovery error may not mean the end of the discovery process. However, in order to respect Observable semantics (error always terminates processing), implementations MUST close or suppress further event handling on the Observable.

Sets the handler function for reading the specified <a>Property</a> matched by <code>name</code>. Throws on error. Returns a reference to the same object for supporting chaining.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <code>readHandler</code> callback function will implement reading a <a>Property</a> and SHOULD be called by implementations when a request for reading a <a>Property</a> is received from the underlying platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        There SHOULD be at most one handler for any given <a>Property</a> and newly added handlers replace the old handlers. If no handler is initialized for any given <a>Property</a>, implementations SHOULD implement a default property read handler.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section> <h3>The <dfn>setPropertyWriteHandler()</dfn> method</h3>
      <p>
        Takes <code>name</code> as string argument and <code>writeHandler</code> as argument of type <a>PropertyWriteHandler</a>. Sets the handler function for writing the specified <a>Property</a> matched by <code>name</code>. Throws on error. Returns a reference to the same object for supporting chaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        There SHOULD be at most one write handler for any given <a>Property</a> and newly added handlers replace the old handlers. If no write handler is initialized for any given <a>Property</a>, implementations SHOULD implement default property update and notifying observers on change.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section> <h3>The <dfn>setActionHandler()</dfn> method</h3>
      <p>
        Takes <code>name</code> as string argument and <code>action</code> as argument of type <a>ActionHandler</a>. Sets the handler function for the specified <a>Action</a> matched by <code>name</code>. Throws on error. Returns a reference to the same object for supporting chaining.
      </p>
      <p>
        If provided, this callback function will implement invoking an <a>Action</a> and SHOULD be called by implementations when a request for invoking a <a>Action</a> is received from the underlying platform. The callback will receive a <code>parameters</code> dictionary argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        There SHOULD be exactly one handler for any given <a>Action</a>. If no handler is initialized for any given <a>Action</a>, implementations SHOULD return error if the action is invoked by any client.

      This document defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the <dfn>UA</dfn> (user agent) that implements the interfaces it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification can be used for implementing the WoT Scripting API in multiple programming languages. The interface definitions are specified in [[!WEBIDL]].
    </p>
    <p>
      The user agent (UA) may be implemented in the browser, or in a separate runtime environment, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or small embedded runtimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use ECMAScript executed in a browser to implement the APIs defined in this document MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use TypeScript or ECMAScript in a runtime to implement the APIs defined in this document MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the TypeScript Bindings defined in the TypeScript specification [[!TYPESCRIPT]].
    </p>
    <p>
      This document serves a general description of the WoT Scripting API. Language and runtime specific issues are discussed in separate extensions of this document.
