    <p>
      The Web of Things is made of entities (<a>Thing</a>s) that can describe their capabilities in a machine-interpretable <a>Thing Description</a> (TD) and expose these capabilities through the <a>WoT Interface</a>, that is, network interactions modeled as <a>Properties</a> (for reading and writing values), <a>Action</a>s (to execute remote procedures with or without return values) and <a>Event</a>s (for signaling notifications).
    </p>
    <p>
      The main <a>Web of Things</a> (WoT) concepts are described in the [[[WOT-ARCHITECTURE]]] specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scripting is an optional building block in WoT and it is typically used in gateways or browsers that are able to run a <a>WoT Runtime</a> and
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/tree/master/applications/script-manager">script management</a>, providing a convenient way to extend WoT support to new types of endpoints and implement WoT applications such as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/tree/master/applications/thing-directory">TD Directory</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification describes an application programming interface (API) representing the <a>WoT Interface</a> that allows scripts to discover, operate <a>Thing</a>s and to expose locally defined <a>Thing</a>s characterized by <a> WoT Interactions</a> specified by a script.
    </p>
    <p>
      The APIs defined in this document deliberately follow the [[[WOT-TD]]] specification closely. It is possible to implement more abstract APIs on top of them, or implementing directly the WoT network facing interface (i.e. the <a>WoT Interface</a>).
    </p>
    <p class="ednote">
      This specification is implemented at least by the <a href="http://www.thingweb.io/">Eclipse Thingweb</a>
      project also known as <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot">node-wot</a>, which is considered the reference open source implementation at the moment.

  <section id="introduction"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      WoT provides layered interoperability based on how <a>Thing</a>s are used:
      "consumed" and "exposed", as defined in the [[[WOT-ARCHITECTURE]]] terminology.
    </p>
    <p>
      By <a>consuming a TD</a>, a client <a>Thing</a> creates a local runtime resource model that allows accessing the <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a> and <a>Events</a> exposed by the server <a>Thing</a> on a remote device.
    </p>
    <div>
      Exposing a <a>Thing</a> requires:
      <ul>
        <li>
          defining a <a>Thing Description</a> (TD),
        </li>
        <li>
          then instantiating a software stack that implements the <a>WoT Interface</a> specified by the <a>TD</a> in order to serve requests for accessing the exposed <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a> and <a>Events</a>,
        </li>
        <li>
           then eventually publishing the <a>Thing Description</a> (for instance to a <a>TD Directory</a> for easier discovery).
        </li>
      </ul>
      This specification describes how to expose and consume <a>Thing</a>s by a script. Also, it defines a generic API for <a>Thing</a> discovery.
    </div>
    <p class="note">
      Typically scripts are meant to be used on bridges or gateways that expose and control simpler devices as WoT <a>Thing</a>s and have means to handle (e.g. install, uninstall, update etc.) and run scripts.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      This specification does not make assumptions on how the <a>WoT Runtime</a> handles and runs scripts, including single or multiple tenancy, script deployment and lifecycle management. The API already supports the generic mechanisms that make it possible to implement script management, for instance by exposing a manager <a>Thing</a> whose <a>Actions</a> (action handlers) implement script lifecycle management operations.

  <section class="informative"> <h3>Use Case Scenarios</h3>
    <p>
      The business use cases listed in the [[WOT-USE-CASES]] document may be
      implemented using this API, based on the scripting use case scenarios
      described here.
    </p>
    <section><h4>Consuming a Thing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a>Consume a TD</a>, i.e. create a programmatic object from a
        <a>Thing Description</a> that exposes <a>WoT Interactions</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Read the value of a <a>Property</a> or a set of properties.</li>
          <li>Set the value of a <a>Property</a> or a set of properties.</li>
          <li>Observe value changes of a <a>Property</a>.</li>
          <li>Invoke an <a>Action</a>.</li>
          <li>Observe WoT <a>Events</a> emitted by the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
          <li>
            Introspect the <a>Thing Description</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section><h4>Exposing a Thing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Exposing the <a>Thing</a> includes generating the protocol bindings in
        order to access lower level functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a local <a>Thing</a> to be exposed, based on <a>Thing Description</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The following use cases can be implemented before creating the
        <a>Thing</a> by editing the <a>Thing Description</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Add a <a>Property</a> definition to the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
          <li>Remove a <a>Property</a> definition from the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
          <li>Add an <a>Action</a> definition to the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
          <li>Remove an <a>Action</a> definition from the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
          <li>Add a WoT <a>Event</a> definition to the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
          <li>Remove a WoT <a>Event</a> definition from the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ednote">
          After evaluating dynamic modifications to <a>Thing Descriptions</a>
          through several versions of this API, the editors concluded that the
          simplest way to represent these use cases is to take an existing
          <a>TD</a>, modify it (i.e. add or remove definitions) and then create
          a new <a>Thing</a> based on the modified <a>TD</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Emit a WoT <a>Event</a>, i.e. notify all subscribed listeners.
      </li>
      <li>Register service handlers for external requests:
        <ul>
          <li>to retrieve a <a>Property</a> value;</li>
          <li>to update a <a>Property</a> value;</li>
          <li>to observe a <a>Property</a>;</li>
          <li>to unobserve a <a>Property</a>;</li>
          <li>
            to invoke an <a>Action</a>: take the parameters from the request, execute the defined action, and return the result;
          </li>
          <li>to subscribe to an <a>Event</a>;</li>
          <li>to unsubscribe from an <a>Event</a>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section><h4>Discovery</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s in a network by sending a broadcast request.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s running in the local <a>WoT Runtime</a>.</li>
      <li>Discover nearby <a>Thing</a>s, for instance connected by NFC or Bluetooth,
        or within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-fence">geo-fence</a>.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s by sending a discovery request to a given <a>TD Directory</a>.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s filtered by filters defined on <a>Thing Description</a>s</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s filtered by semantic queries.</li>
      <li>Stop or suppress an ongoing discovery process.</li>
      <li>
          Optionally specify a timeout to the discovery process after which it is stopped/suppressed.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p class="ednote">
    This specification used to be a Working Draft which was expected to become a W3C Recommendation. However, it is now a WG Note which contains informative statements only. Therefore we need to consider how to deal with the description within this Conformance section.</p>

    <p>
      This specification describes the conformance criteria for the following classes of [= user agent =] (<dfn>UA</dfn>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to requirements of small embedded implementations, splitting WoT client and server interfaces was needed. Then, discovery is a distributed application, but typical scenarios have been covered by a generic discovery API in this specification. This resulted in using 3 conformance classes for a <a>UA</a> that implements this API, one for client, one for server, and one for discovery. An application that uses this API can introspect for the presence of the <code>consume()</code>, <code>produce()</code> and <code>discover()</code> methods on the <a>WoT API object</a> in order to determine which conformance class the <a>UA</a> implements.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <dfn>WoT Consumer</dfn> <a>UA</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Implementations of this conformance class MUST implement the <code>{{ConsumedThing}}</code> interface and the <code>consume()</code> method on the <a>WoT API object</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <dfn>WoT Producer</dfn> <a>UA</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Implementations of this conformance class MUST implement <code>{{ExposedThing}}</code> interface and the <code>produce()</code> method on the <a>WoT API object</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <dfn>WoT Discovery</dfn> <a>UA</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Implementations of this conformance class MUST implement the
          <code><a>ThingDiscoveryProcess</a></code> interface, the
          <code>discover()</code> method, the <code>exploreDirectory()</code> method,
          and the <code>requestThingDescription()</code> method on the
          <a>WoT API object</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      These conformance classes MAY be implemented in a single <a>UA</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification can be used for implementing the WoT Scripting API in multiple programming languages. The interface definitions are specified in [[!WEBIDL]].
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a>UA</a> may be implemented in the browser, or in a separate runtime environment, such as <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> or in small embedded runtimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use ECMAScript executed in a browser to implement the APIs defined in this document MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use TypeScript or ECMAScript in a runtime to implement the APIs defined in this document MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the TypeScript Bindings defined in the TypeScript specification [[!TYPESCRIPT]].

      An <a>Interaction Affordance</a> (or shortly, affordance) is the term used in [[!WOT-TD]]
      when referring to <a>Thing</a> capabilities, as explained in
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/282">TD issue 282</a>.
      However, this term is not well understood outside the <a>TD</a> semantic context.
      Hence for the sake of readability, this document will use the previous term
      <a>WoT interaction</a> or, simply, <em>interaction</em> instead.

        Fetching a <a>TD</a> given a URL should be done with an external method, such as the <a data-cite="fetch#fetch-api">Fetch API</a> or a HTTP client library, which offer already standardized options on specifying fetch details.

  <section> <h3>Using {{InteractionInput}} and {{InteractionOutput}}</h3>
    <p>
      As illustrated in the next pictures, the {{InteractionOutput}} interface
      is used every time implementations provide data to scripts, while
      {{InteractionInput}} is used when the scripts pass data to the
      implementation.

      When a {{ConsumedThing}} reads data, it receives it from the implementation
      as an {{InteractionOutput}} object.

  <section> <h3>Error handling</h3>
    <p>
      The algorithms in this API define the errors to be reported to application
      scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The errors reported to the other communication end are mapped and
      encapsulated by the <a>Protocol Bindings</a>.

    <p class="ednote">
      This topic is still being discussed in
      <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/issues/200">Issue #200</a>.
      A standardized error mapping would be needed in order to ensure consistency
      in mapping script errors to protocol errors and vice versa. In particular,
      when algorithms say "error received from the <a>Protocol Bindings</a>",
      that will be factored out as an explicit error mapping algorithm. Currently,
      that is encapsulated by implementations.

      <h3>The <dfn>subscribeEvent()</dfn> method</h3>

      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>formIndex</dfn> property, if defined, represents an application
        hint for which <code>Form</code> definition, identified by this index,
        of the <a>TD</a> to use for the given WoT interaction.
        Implementations SHOULD use the <code>Form</code> with this index for
        making the interaction, but MAY override this value if the index is not
        found or not valid.
        If not defined, implementations SHOULD attempt to use the
        <code>Form</code> definitions in order of appearance as listed in the
        <a>TD</a> for the given Wot Interaction.

        parsed JSON objects</a> defined in [[!WOT-TD]].
      </p>
      <p class="ednote">
        The support for URI variables comes from the need, exposed by the [[[WOT-TD]]] specification, to be able to describe
        existing RESTful endpoints that use them. However, it should be possible to write a Thing Description that would use
        <a>Action</a>s for representing this kind of interactions and model the URI variables as action parameters. In that case,
        implementations can serialize the parameters as URI variables, and therefore, the |options| parameter could be
        dismissed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>data</dfn> property if defined, represents additional opaque

        User provided callback that is given an argument of type

        and handling <a>Event</a> notifications.

      <h3>Constructing {{ExposedThing}}</h3>
      <p>
        The {{ExposedThing}} interface extends {{ConsumedThing}}. It
        is constructed from a full or partial {{ThingDescription}} object.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
         Note that an existing {{ThingDescription}} object can be optionally modified (for instance by adding or removing elements on its |properties|, |actions| and |events| internal properties) and the resulting object can used for constructing an
         {{ExposedThing}} object. This is the current way of adding and
         removing <a>Property</a>, <a>Action</a> and <a>Event</a> definitions, as illustrated in the <a href="#exposedthing-examples">examples</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Before invoking <a href="#dom-exposedthing-expose">expose()</a>, the {{ExposedThing}} object does not serve any requests. This allows first constructing {{ExposedThing}} and then initialize its <a>Properties</a> and service handlers before starting serving requests.
      </p>
      <div>
        To construct an {{ExposedThing}} with the {{ExposedThingInit}}
        |init:ExposedThingInit|, run the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            If invoking this method is not allowed for the current scripting context for security reasons, [= exception/throw =] a {{SecurityError}} and stop.
          </li>
          <li>Run the <a>expand an ExposedThingInit</a> steps on |init|. if that fails re-[= exception/throw =] the error and stop. Otherwise store the obtained |td:ThingDescription| </li>
          <li>
            Run the <a>expand a TD</a> steps on |td|. If that fails, re-[= exception/throw =] the error and stop.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let |thing:ExposedThing| be a new {{ExposedThing}} object.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the {{ExposedThing/[[td]]}} of |thing| to |td|.

      <p>
        A function that is called when an external request for reading a

        It returns a {{Promise}} and resolves with an {{ReadableStream}} object or an
        <a data-cite="ECMASCRIPT#sec-ecmascript-data-types-and-values">

    <section> <h3>The <dfn>setPropertyReadHandler()</dfn> method</h3>

        received for reading the specified <a>Property</a> matched by |name|.
        Throws on error.
        Returns a reference to |this| object for supporting chaining.
      </p>
      <p class="ednote">
        Note that there is no need to register handlers for handling requests
        for reading multiple or all <a>Properties</a>. The request and reply

      <p>
         The |handler| callback function should implement reading a <a>Property</a> and SHOULD be called by implementations when a request for reading a <a>Property</a> is received from the underlying platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        There MUST be at most one handler for any given <a>Property</a>, so newly added handlers MUST replace the previous handlers.

    <h2>The <dfn>ThingDiscoveryProcess</dfn> interface</h2>
    <p>
      Discovery is a distributed application that requires provisioning and support from participating network nodes (clients, servers, directory services). This API models the client side of typical discovery schemes supported by various IoT deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {{ThingDiscoveryProcess}} object provides the properties and methods
      controlling the discovery process and returning the results.
    </p>
    <pre class="idl">
      [SecureContext, Exposed=(Window,Worker)]

      or completed with no more results to report.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>error</dfn> property represents the last error that occurred during the discovery process. Typically used for critical errors that stop discovery.

        <ol>
          <li>
            If |filter| is not an object or `null`, [= exception/throw =] a {{TypeError}} and stop.

          <li>
            Let |discovery:ThingDiscoveryProcess| be a new {{ThingDiscoveryProcess}} object.

          <li>
            Set |discovery|.{{ThingDiscoveryProcess/[[filter]]}} to |filter|.

                Retrieve |td:ThingDescription| as a JSON object, using the <a>Protocol Binding</a>
                used by the underlying discovery process (as specified by |link|).
                In the case of an HTTP(S) Binding, this process could use the
                <a data-cite="fetch#fetch-api">Fetch API</a>

        Using the {{Symbol/asyncIterator}} provided by the Discovery object, we can iterate asynchronously over the results and perform operations with the obtained {{ThingDescription}} objects.

    <p>
      A detailed discussion of security and privacy considerations for the Web of Things, including a threat model that can be adapted to various circumstances, is
      presented in the informative document [[!WOT-SECURITY]].
      This section discusses only security and privacy risks and possible mitigations
      directly relevant to the scripts and WoT Scripting API.
    </p>
    <p>
      A suggested set of best practices to improve security for WoT devices and
      services has been documented in [[!WOT-SECURITY]].
      That document may be updated as security measures evolve.
      Following these practices does not guarantee security,
      but it might help avoid commonly known vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <div>
      The WoT security risks and possible mitigations are concerning the following groups:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implementors of WoT Runtimes that do not implement a Scripting Runtime.
          The [[!WOT-ARCHITECTURE]] document provides generic security guidelines
          for this group.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementors of the WoT Scripting API in a WoT Scripting Runtime. This is the main scope and is covered in the
          <a href="#sec-security-consideration-runtime">
          Scripting Runtime Security and Privacy Risks</a> sub-section that
          contains normative text regarding security.

      <h3>Scripting Runtime Security and Privacy Risks</h3>
      <p>
        This section is normative and contains specific risks relevant for the WoT Scripting Runtime.
      </p>

      <section id="sec-security-consideration-input">
        <h3>Corrupted Input Security and Privacy Risk</h3>
        <p>
          A typical way to compromise any process is to send it a corrupted input
          via one of the exposed interfaces. This can be done to a script instance
          using WoT interface it exposes.
        </p>
        <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          Implementors of this API SHOULD perform validation on all script inputs. In addition to input validation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzzing</a> should be used to verify that the input processing is done correctly. There are many tools and techniques in existence to do such validation. More details can be found in [[!WOT-SECURITY]].

      <section id="sec-security-consideration-device-direct-access">
        <h3>Physical Device Direct Access Security and Privacy Risk</h3>
        <p>
          In case a script is compromised or misbehaving, the underlying physical device (and potentially surrounded environment) can be damaged if a script can use directly exposed native device interfaces. If such interfaces lack safety checks on their inputs, they might bring the underlying physical device (or environment) to an unsafe state (i.e. device overheats and explodes).
        </p>
        <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          The WoT Scripting Runtime SHOULD avoid directly exposing the native device interfaces to the script developers. Instead, a WoT Scripting Runtime should provide a hardware abstraction layer for accessing the native device interfaces. Such hardware abstraction layer should refuse to execute commands that might put the device (or environment) to an unsafe state.
          Additionally, in order to reduce the damage to a physical WoT device in cases a script gets compromised, it is important to minimize the number of interfaces that are exposed or accessible to a particular script based on its functionality.

      <section id="sec-security-consideration-update-provisioning">
        <h3>Provisioning and Update Security Risk</h3>
        <p>
          If the WoT Scripting Runtime supports post-manufacturing provisioning
          or updates of scripts, WoT Scripting Runtime or any related data
          (including security credentials), it can be a major attack vector.
          An attacker can try to modify any above described element
          during the update or provisioning process or simply
          provision attacker's code and data directly.
        </p>
        <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
            Post-manufacturing provisioning or update of scripts,
            WoT Scripting Runtime or any related data should be done in a secure fashion.
            A set of recommendations for secure update and post-manufacturing
            provisioning can be found in [[!WOT-SECURITY]].

      <section id="sec-security-consideration-credentials-storage">
        <h3>Security Credentials Storage Security and Privacy Risk</h3>
        <p>
          Typically the WoT Scripting Runtime needs to store the security credentials that are provisioned to a WoT device to operate in WoT network. If an attacker can compromise the confidentiality or integrity of these credentials, then it can obtain access to the WoT assets, impersonate WoT things or devices or create Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks.
        </p>
        <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          The WoT Scripting Runtime should securely store the provisioned security credentials, guaranteeing their integrity and confidentiality.
          In case there are more than one tenant on a single WoT-enabled device, a WoT Scripting Runtime should guarantee isolation of each tenant provisioned security credentials.
          Additionally, in order to minimize a risk that provisioned security credentials get compromised, the WoT Scripting Runtime should not expose any API for scripts to query the provisioned security credentials.

        <h3>Corrupted Script Input Security and Privacy Risk</h3>
        <p>
          A script instance may receive data formats defined by the TD, or data formats defined by the applications. While the WoT Scripting Runtime SHOULD perform validation on all input fields defined by the TD, scripts may be still exploited by input data.
        </p>

      <section id="sec-security-consideration-script-processing">
        <h3>Denial Of Service Security Risk</h3>
        <p>
          If a script performs a heavy functional processing on received requests before the request is authenticated, it presents a great risk for Denial-Of-Service (DOS) attacks.
        </p>
        <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          Scripts should avoid heavy functional processing without prior successful
          authentication of requestor. The set of recommended authentication mechanisms

  <section class="appendix">
    <h2>API design rationale</h2>
    <p>
      API rationale usually belongs to a separate document, but in the WoT case
      the complexity of the context justifies including basic rationale here.
    </p>
    <section> <h3>Approaches to WoT application development</h3>
      <p>
        The WoT Interest Group and Working Group have explored different
        approaches to application development for WoT that have been all
        implemented and tested.
      </p>
      <section> <h3>No Scripting API</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to develop WoT applications that only use the
          <a>WoT network interface</a>, typically exposed by a WoT gateway that
          presents a RESTful API towards clients and implements IoT protocol
          plugins that communicate with supported IoT deployments. One such
          implementation is the
          <a href="https://iot.mozilla.org/">Mozilla WebThings</a> platform.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section> <h3>Simple Scripting API</h3>
        <p>
          WoT <a>Thing</a>s show good synergy with software objects, so a
          <a>Thing</a> can be represented as a software object, with <a>Properties</a> represented as object properties, <a>Action</a>s as methods, and
          <a>Event</a>s as events. In addition, metadata is stored in special
          properties. Consuming and exposing is done with factory methods that
          produce a software object that directly represents a remote <a>Thing</a>
          and its interactions. One such implementation is the
          <a href="https://github.com/draggett/arena-webhub">Arena Web Hub</a>
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next example, a <a>Thing</a> that represents interactions with
          a lock would look like the following: the |status| property
          and the <code>open()</code> method are directly exposed on the object.
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Open a lock with a simple API">
          let lock = await WoT.consume(‘https://td.my.com/lock-00123’);
          console.log(lock.status);
          lock.open('withThisKey');
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section> <h3>This API, aligned with the [[[WOT-TD]]] specification</h3>
        <p>
          Since the direct mapping of <a>Thing</a>s to software objects have had
          some challenges, this specification takes another approach that
          exposes software objects to represent the <a>Thing</a> metadata as
          data property and the WoT interactions as methods. One implementation
          is <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot">node-wot</a>
          in the <a href="http://www.thingweb.io/">Eclipse ThingWeb</a> project,
          which is the current reference implementation of the API specified in
          this document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same example now would look like the following: the
          |status| property and the <code>open()</code> method are
          represented indirectly.
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Open a lock">
          let res = await fetch(‘https://td.my.com/lock-00123’);
          let td = await res.json();
          let lock = new ConsumedThing(td);
          console.log(lock.readProperty(‘status’));
          lock.invokeAction(‘open’, 'withThisKey');
        </pre>
      </section>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the WoT WG decided to explore the third option that
        closely follows the [[[WOT-TD]]] specification. Based on this, a simple
        API can also be implemented.
        Since Scripting is an optional module in WoT, this leaves room for
        applications that only use the <a>WoT network interface</a>.
        Therefore all three approaches above are supported by the [[[WOT-TD]]] specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the <a>WoT network interface</a> can be implemented in many languages
        and runtimes. Consider this API an example for what needs to be taken
        into consideration when designing a Scripting API for WoT.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Fetching and validating a TD</h4>
      <p>
        The <code>fetch(url)</code> method has been part of this API in earlier versions. However, now fetching a <a>TD</a> given a URL should be done with an external method, such as the <a data-cite="fetch#fetch-api">Fetch API</a> or a HTTP client library, which offer already standardized options on specifying fetch details. The reason is that while simple fetch operations (covering most use cases) could be done in this API, when various fetch options were needed, there was no point in duplicating existing work to re-expose those options in this API.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since fetching a <a>TD</a> has been scoped out, and <a>TD</a> validation
        is defined externally in the [[[WOT-TD]]] specification, that is scoped out, too.
        This specification expects a <a>TD</a> as
        <a data-cite="infra#parse-json-bytes-to-a-javascript-value">parsed JSON object</a> that has been validated according to the [[[WOT-TD]]] specification.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Factory vs constructors</h4>
      <p>
        The factory methods for consuming and exposing <a>Thing</a>s are asynchronous and fully validate the input <a>TD</a>. In addition, one can also construct {{ConsumedThing}} and {{ExposedThing}} by providing a parsed and validated <a>TD</a>. Platform initialization is then done when needed during the WoT interactions.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Observers</h4>
      <p>
        Earlier drafts used the
        <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable">Observer</a>
        construct, but since it has not become standard, a new design was needed
        that was light enough for embedded implementations. Therefore observing
        <a>Property</a> changes and handling WoT <a>Event</a>s is done with
        callback registrations.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Using Events</h4>
      <div>
        This API ended up not using software events at all, for the following
        reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Subscription to WoT <a>Event</a>s may be different from handling software events (subscription might need parameters, might involve security tokens etc).
          </li>
          <li>
            Most implementations are for Node.js and browser implementations will likely be libraries (because possible dependency management issues in native implementations), using Events has been challenging.
          </li>
          <li>
            Observing <a>Property</a> changes and handling WoT <a>Event</a>s is done with the solution above.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Polymorphic functions</h4>
      <p>
        The reason to use function names like <code>readProperty()</code>, <code>readMultipleProperties()</code> etc. instead of a generic polymorphic <code>read()</code> function is that the current names map exactly to the <code>"op"</code> vocabulary from the <a data-cite="WOT-TD#form">Form</a> definition in the [[[WOT-TD]]] specification.
      </p>
