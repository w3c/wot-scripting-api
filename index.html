    <p>
      This specification describes a programming interface to [the Web of Things](http://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html) (<code>WoT</code>), that allows scripts run on a <a>Thing</a> to discover and access other <a>Thing</a>s through a Client API, provide resources characterized by properties, actions and events through a Server API, and access locally attached hardware through a Physical API.
    </p>
    <p class="ednote">[DP] This is the only place where "Physical API" is mentioned.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="sotd">
    <p>
      Implementers need to be aware that this specification is considered unstable. Vendors interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation phase should subscribe to the [repository](https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api) and take part in the discussions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>
      This document defines conformance criteria that apply to a single product: the <dfn>UA</dfn> (user agent) that implements the interfaces it contains.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification can be used for implementing the WoT Scripting API in multiple language bindings. Currently ECMAScript and TypeScript definitions are described in this document. For specifying bindings in other languages, extensions of this document may be created later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user agent (UA) may be implemented in the browser, or in a separate runtime environment, such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) or small embedded runtimes such as the [JavaScript Runtime for Zephyr OS](https://www.zephyrproject.org/community/blog/introducing-javascript-runtime-zephyr-os).
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use ECMAScript executed in a browser to implement the APIs defined in this document MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use TypeScript or ECMAScript in a runtime to implement the APIs defined in this document MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the TypeScript Bindings defined in the TypeScript specification [[!TYPESCRIPT]].
    </p>
    <p>
      This document serves a general description of the WoT Scripting API. Language and runtime specific issues are discussed in separate extensions of this document.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section> <h2>Terminology and conventions</h2>
    <p>
      The following terms are defined in [[!WOT-PRACTICES]]:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn data-lt="Things">Thing</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A physical or virtual entity that represents physicality, such as a device, a group of devices, a room, or a software stack that exposes <a>WoT interface</a>s.</dd>

      <dt><dfn data-lt="TD|TDs|Thing Descriptions">Thing Description</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Semantic metadata of a Thing as well as a functional description of its WoT Interface (it relies on the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and is currently serialized in <a>JSON-LD</a> by default): semantic context, interaction resources (such as properties, actions and events), communication (protocol, data serialization, bindings), and security related data (e.g. keys, certificates, policies etc).</dd>

      <dt><dfn>WoT Interface</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Resource-oriented Web interface (often called "Web API") that allows access to <a>Things</a> exposed over a network using different <a>Protocol Bindings</a>, as defined by <a>Thing Description</a>s.</dd>

      <dt><dfn>Protocol Bindings</dfn></dt>
      <dd>Mapping WoT <a>Thing</a> interactions to specific protocol suites. Protocol bindings are being defined for HTTP, CoAP, Bluetooth Smart (BLE), MQTT, WebSockets, etc.</dd>

      <dt><dfn>JSON-LD</dfn></dt>
      <dd>A JSON document that is augmented with support for Linked Data by providing an <code>@context</code> property with a defining URI [[!JSON-LD]].</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      <dfn data-lt="consume|consume a TD|consuming a TD">Consuming a Thing Description</dfn> means parsing the <a>Thing Description</a> and building a resource model with the use of <a>Protocol Bindings</a> that can be used in a script for accessing and controlling the Thing. A <a>Thing</a> when starts up, consumes its own <a>TD</a>, then it exposes its <a>WoT interface</a> as a server. Note that a script on a <a>Thing</a> may consume other <a>TD</a>s and expose a combined interface of the consumed <a>Things</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <dfn>WoT Runtime</dfn> or <dfn>WR</dfn> is defined as a script execution environment that manages the lifecycle of WoT application scripts, implements a script interpreter, an event loop, a security enforcement point for access management and uses lower-level APIs to provide access to local and remote resources. A <a>WR</a> should be isolated from other execution environments on memory address space, storage address space (file system), network namespace, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      In this version of the specification, a <a>WR</a> is assumed to run a single script that uses this API to define one or more <a>Things</a> that share a common event loop. Script deployment methods are out of scope of this version. In future versions, running multiple scripts (as modules) may be possible, and script deployment MAY be implemented using a manager <a>Thing</a> whose actions permit script lifecycle management operations.
    </p>
      <p>
       A <a>Thing</a> is represented either as a <a>ConsumedThing</a> (for <a>Things</a> obtained by discovery or retrieve operations) or <a>ExposedThing</a> (for <a>Thing</a>s created with this API inside the <a>WR</a>). All <a>ExposedThing</a>s contained in a <a>WR</a> are serving external requests through the same event loop, and are said to be <dfn>local Things</dfn> to each other. All other <a>Thing</a>s that run in a different <a>WR</a>, even if on the same physical hardware, are said to be <dfn>remote Things</dfn> to each other. Note that there may also be local  <a>ConsumedThing</a> objects as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/url-1/"><dfn>URL</dfn></a> and
      <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-path">
      <dfn>URL path</dfn></a> are defined in [[!URL]].

      but it can have many <code>Document</code> objects, with their associated
      <code><a>Window</a></code> objects. The <a>script execution context</a>

  <section id="introduction"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      As described in the [WoT Current Practices](http://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html#vision), the Web of Things is made of <a>Thing</a>s that can describe their capabilities in a machine-interpretable format, the <a>Thing Description</a> (TD). By <a>consuming a TD</a>, a <a>Thing</a> creates a runtime resource model that allows accessing the <a>Thing</a> by an application.

      The overall WoT concepts are described in the [WoT Architecture](https://w3c.github.io/wot-architecture/) document.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="informative"> <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <p>
      The following scripting use cases are covered in this specification:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discover all <a>Things</a> in the WoT network by sending a broadcast request.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Things</a> running in the local <a>WoT Runtime</a>.</li>
      <li>Discover nearby <a>Things</a>, for instance by NFC or Bluetooth.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Things</a> by sending a discovery request to a given registry.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s by filters defined on <a>Thing Description</a>s</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s by semantic filters.</li>
      <li>Stop or suppress an ongoing discovery process.</li>
      <li>Fetch and <a>consume a TD</a> of a remote <a>Thing</a>.</li>

            Default events are the following:
            <ul>
              <li>A property has changed.</li>
              <li>An action has been invoked.</li>
              <li><a>Thing Description</a> has changed, i.e. properties, events or actions have been defined, removed, or the definition has changed.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Retrieve a thing.</li>
      <li>Create and expose a local <a>Thing</a> based on a <a>Thing Description</a>.</li>
      <li>Programmatically create and expose a local <a>Thing</a>. This may include the following use cases:
        <ul>
          <li>Create a local <a>Thing</a>.</li>
          <li>Add a property definition to the <a>Thing</a>.</li>

          <li>Attach semantic information to an action</li>
          <li>Attach semantic information to a property</li>
          <li>Attach semantic information to an event</li>
          <li>Emit an event, i.e. notify all listeners subscribed to that event.</li>
          <li>Register handlers for external requests:
            <ul>
              <li>to retrieve a property value;</li>
              <li>to update a property value;</li>
              <li>to run an action: take the parameters from the request, execute the defined action, and return the result;</li>
              <li>to add a listener to an event;</li>
              <li>to remove an event listener.</li>
              <li>to fetch the <a>Thing Description</a>;</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Register the Thing.</li>
      <li>Unregister the Thing.</li>
      <li>Start the exposed <a>Thing</a> in order to process external requests.</li>
      <li>Stop the exposed <a>Thing</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The following use cases are being considered for next versions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Add, remove and update the definition of a property on a Thing that runs in the same the WoT Runtime.</li>
      <li>Add, remove and update the definition of an action on a Thing that runs in the same the WoT Runtime.</li>
      <li>Add, remove and update the definition of an event on a Thing that runs in the same the WoT Runtime.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section data-dfn-for="ThingInit"> <h2>WoT Data Representation</h2>
    <p>
      WoT provides a unified representation for data exchange between <a>Things</a>, standardized in the [Wot Things Description](https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/) specification.
      <a>Thing Descriptions</a> are represented as dictionary objects in this API.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section> <h2>The WoT Scripting API</h2>
    <p>
      The API object represents an implementation of the <a>WoT Runtime</a> and provides functionality to obtain <a>Thing</a>s by discovery, retrieval, or creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>WoT object</dfn> exposes only functions and has no internal state.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
       Browser implementations SHOULD use a namespace object such as `wot`, and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)-like runtimes MAY provide the API object through the [`require()`](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html) or [`import`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-imports) mechanism.
    </p>

    <section data-dfn-for="WoT">
      <h2><dfn>WoT</dfn> interface</h2>
      <p>The <a>WoT</a> interface offers three methods for discovering, retrieving, and creating a thing.</p>

        };
      </pre>
      <ul>
        <li>The <dfn>discover()</dfn> method returns an [Observable](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable) object that can be subscribed and unsubscribed to.</li>
        <li>The <dfn>retrieve()</dfn> method by provindung an <code>url</code> returns a [Promise](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-promise) of a <a>ConsumedThing</a>.</li>
        <li>
          The <dfn>createLocalThing()</dfn> method returns a [Promise](https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#idl-promise) of a locally created <a>ExposedThing</a> based on the provided initialization paramaters.

    </pre>
    <p class="note">
      Note that canceling a discovery (through unsubscribe) may not be successful in all cases, for instance when discovery is based on open ended broadcast requests. However, once `unsubscribe()` has been called,  implementations MUST suppress further event handling ( i.e. further discoveries and errors) on the Observable. Also, a discovery error may not mean the end of the discovery process. However, in order to respect Observable semantics (error always terminates processing), implementations MUST close or suppress further event handling on the Observable.

      let subscription = wot.discover({ type: "local" }).subscribe(

  <section> <h2 id="security">Security and Privacy</h2>
    <p class="ednote">[DP] The security task force might want to check this section.</p>
    <p>
      The trust model, attacker model, threat model and possible mitigation
      proposals for the Wot Scripting API are presented in the WoT Security and Privacy document.
      This section presents the chosen security and privacy model through normative requirements to implementations.
    </p>

    <section> <h3>Chain of Trust</h3>
      <p>
        Things discoverable and accessible in a WoT network SHOULD be identified and authenticated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The integrity of WoT communication SHOULD be ensured by implementations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section> <h3>Threat Model</h3>
      <p>
      The main threats are summarized in the WoT Security and Privacy document.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this specification the following threats are considered of the highest priority:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Unauthorized gathering of user-sensitive information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Vulnerability of the underlying protocols.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protect the integrity of <a>Thing</a>s and <a>Thing Description</a>s.
        </li>
      </ul>
