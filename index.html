    <p>
      The main <a>Web of Things</a> (WoT) concepts are described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-architecture-20190516/">WoT Architecture</a> document. The Web of Things is made of entities (<a>Thing</a>s) that can describe their capabilities in a machine-interpretable <a>Thing Description</a> (TD) and expose these capabilities through the <a>WoT Interface</a>, that is, network interactions modeled as <a>Properties</a> (for reading and writing values), <a>Action</a>s (to execute remote procedures with or without return values) and <a>Event</a>s (for signaling notifications).
    </p>
    <p>
      Scripting is an optional "convenience" building block in WoT and it is typically used in gateways that are able to run a <a>WoT Runtime</a> and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/tree/master/applications/script-manager">script management</a>, providing a convenient way to extend WoT support to new types of endpoints and implement WoT applications such as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/tree/master/applications/thing-directory">Thing Directory</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification describes a programming interface representing the <a>WoT Interface</a> that allows scripts to discover, operate <a>Thing</a>s and to expose locally defined <a>Things</a> characterized by <a> WoT Interactions</a> specified by a script.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specification deliberately follows the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/">WoT Thing Description specification</a> closely. It is possible to implement simpler APIs on top of this API, or implementing directly the WoT network facing interface (i.e. the <a>WoT Interface</a>).
    </p>
    <p class="ednote">
      This specification is implemented at least by the <a href="http://www.thingweb.io/">Thingweb</a> project also known as <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot">node-wot</a>, which is considered the reference open source implementation at the moment. Check its <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot"> source code</a>, including <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot">examples</a>. Other, closed source implementations have been made by WG member companies and tested against <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot">node-wot</a> in plug-fests.

  <section id="introduction"> <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      WoT provides layered interoperability based on how <a>Thing</a>s are used:
      "consumed" and "exposed", as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-architecture-20190516/#terminology">defined</a> in [[WOT-ARCHITECTURE]].
    </p>
    <p>
      By <a>consuming a TD</a>, a client <a>Thing</a> creates a local runtime resource model that allows accessing the <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a> and <a>Events</a> exposed by the server <a>Thing</a> on a remote device.
    </p>
    <div>
      Exposing a <a>Thing</a> requires:
      <ul>
        <li>
          defining a <a>Thing Description</a> (TD),
        </li>
        <li>
          then instantiating a software stack that implements the <a>WoT Interface</a> specified by the <a>TD</a> in order to serve requests for accessing the exposed <a>Properties</a>, <a>Actions</a> and <a>Events</a>,
        </li>
        <li>
           then eventually publishing the <a>Thing Description</a> (for instance to a <a>Thing Directory</a> directory for easier discovery).
        </li>
      </ul>
      This specification describes how to expose and consume <a>Thing</a>s by a script. Also, it defines a generic API for <a>Thing</a> discovery.
    </div>
    <p class="note">
      Typically scripts are meant to be used on bridges or gateways that expose and control simpler devices as WoT <a>Thing</a>s and have means to handle (e.g. install, uninstall, update etc.) and run scripts.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      This specification does not make assumptions on how the <a>WoT Runtime</a> handles and runs scripts, including single or multiple tenancy, script deployment and lifecycle management. The API already supports the generic mechanisms that make it possible to implement script management, for instance by exposing a manager <a>Thing</a> whose <a>Actions</a> (action handlers) implement script lifecycle management operations.

  <section class="informative"> <h3>Use Cases</h3>
    <p>
      The following scripting use cases are supported in this specification:
    </p>
    <section><h4>Consuming a Thing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a>Consume a TD</a>, i.e. create a programmatic object from a <a>Thing Description</a> that exposes <a>WoT Interactions</a>:
        <ul>
          <li>Read the value of a <a>Property</a> or a set of properties.</li>
          <li>Set the value of a <a>Property</a> or a set of properties.</li>
          <li>Observe value changes of a <a>Property</a>.</li>
          <li>Invoke an <a>Action</a>.</li>
          <li>Observe WoT <a>Events</a> emitted by the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
          <li>
            Introspect the <a>Thing Description</a>, including the list of linked resources based on the <a>Thing Description</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section><h4>Exposing a Thing</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Exposing the <a>Thing</a> includes generating the protocol bindings in order to access lower level functionality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a local <a>Thing</a> to be exposed, based on a <a>Thing Description</a> provided in string serialized format, or out of an existing <a>Thing</a> object.
      </li>
      <li>Add a <a>Property</a> definition to the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
      <li>Remove a <a>Property</a> definition from the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
      <li>Add an <a>Action</a> definition to the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
      <li>Remove an <a>Action</a> definition from the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
      <li>Add a WoT <a>Event</a> definition to the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
      <li>Remove a WoT <a>Event</a> definition from the <a>Thing</a>.</li>
      <li>
        Emit a WoT <a>Event</a>, i.e. notify all subscribed listeners.
      </li>
      <li>Register service handlers for external requests:
        <ul>
          <li>to retrieve a <a>Property</a> value;</li>
          <li>to update a <a>Property</a> value;</li>
          <li>
            to invoke an <a>Action</a>: take the parameters from the request, execute the defined action, and return the result;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section><h4>Discovery</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s in a network by sending a broadcast request.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s running in the local <a>WoT Runtime</a>.</li>
      <li>Discover nearby <a>Thing</a>s, for instance connected by NFC or Bluetooth.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s by sending a discovery request to a given registry.</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s filtered by filters defined on <a>Thing Description</a>s</li>
      <li>Discover <a>Thing</a>s filtered by semantic queries.</li>
      <li>Stop or suppress an ongoing discovery process.</li>
      <li>
          Optionally specify a timeout to the discovery process after which it is stopped/suppressed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="conformance">
    <p>
      This specification describes the conformance criteria for the following classes of <dfn>user agent</dfn> (<dfn>UA</dfn>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to requirements of small embedded implementations, splitting WoT client and server interfaces was needed. Then, discovery is a distributed application, but typical scenarios have been covered by a generic discovery API in this specification. This resulted in using 3 conformance classes for a <a>UA</a> that implements this API, one for client, one for server, and one for discovery. An application that uses this API can introspect for the presence of the <code>consume()</code>, <code>produce()</code> and <code>discover()</code> methods on the <a>WoT API object</a> in order to determine which conformance class the <a>UA</a> implements.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>
        <dfn>WoT Consumer</dfn> <a>UA</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Implementations of this conformance class MUST implement the <code>{{ConsumedThing}}</code> interface and the <code>consume()</code> method on the <a>WoT API object</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <dfn>WoT Producer</dfn> <a>UA</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Implementations of this conformance class MUST implement <code>{{ExposedThing}}</code> interface and the <code>produce()</code> method on the <a>WoT API object</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <dfn>WoT Discovery</dfn> <a>UA</a>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>
          Implementations of this conformance class MUST implement the <code><a>ThingDiscovery</a></code> interface and the <code>discover()</code> method on the <a>WoT API object</a>.
        </p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
      These conformance classes MAY be implemented in a single <a>UA</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This specification can be used for implementing the WoT Scripting API in multiple programming languages. The interface definitions are specified in [[!WEBIDL]].
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a>UA</a> may be implemented in the browser, or in a separate runtime environment, such as <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> or in small embedded runtimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use ECMAScript executed in a browser to implement the APIs defined in this document MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]].
    </p>
    <p>
      Implementations that use TypeScript or ECMAScript in a runtime to implement the APIs defined in this document MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the TypeScript Bindings defined in the TypeScript specification [[!TYPESCRIPT]].
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The <dfn>ThingDescription</dfn> type</h2>
    <pre class="idl">
      typedef object ThingDescription;
    </pre>

    <p>
      Represents a <a>Thing Description</a> (<a>TD</a>) as
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description/#thing">defined</a> in
      [[!WOT-TD]]. It is expected to be
      a <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#parse-json-from-bytes">parsed JSON object</a> that is validated using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/#json-schema-for-validation">JSON schema validation</a>.
    </p>
    <section> <h3> Fetching a Thing Description</h3>
      <p>
        Fetching a <a>TD</a> given a URL should be done with an external method, such as the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api">Fetch API</a> or a HTTP client library, which offer already standardized options on specifying fetch details.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="Fetching a Thing Description">
        try {
          let res = await fetch('https://tds.mythings.biz/sensor11');
          // ... additional checks possible on res.headers
          let td = await res.json();
          let thing = new ConsumedThing(td);
          console.log("Thing name: " + thing.getThingDescription().title);
        } catch (err) {
          console.log("Fetching TD failed", err.message);
        }
      </pre>
    </section>

    <section> <h3>Expanding a Thing Description</h3>
      <p>
        Note that [[WOT-TD]] allows using a shortened <a>Thing Description</a>
        by the means of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/#sec-default-values">defaults</a> and requiring clients to expand them with default values specified in
        [[WOT-TD]] for the properties that are not explicitly defined in a given
        <a>TD</a>.
      </p>
      <div>
        To <dfn>expand a TD</dfn> given |td:ThingDescription|, run the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            For each item in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/#sec-default-values">TD default values</a> table from [[!WOT-TD]], if the term is not defined in |td|, add the term definition with the default value specified in [[!WOT-TD]].
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section> <h3>Validating a Thing Description</h3>
      <p>
        The [[!WOT-TD]] specification defines how a <a>TD</a> should be validated.
        Therefore, this API expects the {{ThingDescription}} objects be validated before used as parameters. This specification defines a basic <a>TD</a> validation as follows.
      </p>
      <div>
        To <dfn>validate a TD</dfn> given |td:ThingDescription|, run the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            If |td| is not an object, [= exception/throw =] a
            {{"TypeError"}} and abort these steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            If any of the mandatory properties defined in [[!WOT-TD]] for
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/#thing">Thing</a>
            that don't have <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/#sec-default-values">default definitions</a>
            are missing from |td|, [= exception/throw =] a
            {{"TypeError"}} and abort these steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            If <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/#json-schema-for-validation">JSON schema validation</a> fails on |td|, [= exception/throw =] a
            {{"TypeError"}} and abort these steps.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

  <section> <h2>Handling interaction data</h2>
  <p>
    As specified in [[WOT-TD]], <a>WoT interactions</a> extend <a>DataSchema</a>
    and include a number of possible <a>Form</a>s, out of which one is selected
    for the interaction. The
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/#form">
    Form</a> contains a `contentType` to describe the data.
    For certain content types, a <a>DataSchema</a> is defined, based on
    <a>JSON schema</a>, making possible to represent these contents as
    JavaScript types and eventually set range constraints on the data.

      Belongs to the <a>WoT Consumer</a> conformance class and represents the
      <a>WoT Interaction</a> data provided by application scripts to the UA.

    <p>
      {{ReadableStream}} is meant to be used for <a>WoT Interactions</a> that
      don't have a <a>DataSchema</a> in the <a>Thing Description</a>, only a
      {{Form}}'s `contentType` that can be represented by a stream.

        The <dfn data-dfn-for="InteractionOptions">InteractionOptions</dfn> dictionary

      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>formIndex</dfn> property, if defined, represents an application
        hint for which <code>Form</code> definition, identified by this index,
        of the <a>TD</a> to use for the given WoT interaction.
        Implementations SHOULD use the <code>Form</code> with this index for
        making the interaction, but MAY override this value if the index is not
        found or not valid.
        If not defined, implementations SHOULD attempt to use the

        As discussed in <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/issues/193">
        Issue #193</a>, the design decision is that write interactions only

        <a>TD</a>s should capture the schema of the <a>Property</a>
        values, including precision and alternative formats. When a return
        value is expected from the interaction, an <a>Action</a> should be used
        instead of a <a>Property</a>.

      <h3>Constructing {{ExposedThing}}</h3>
      <p>
        The {{ExposedThing}} interface extends {{ConsumedThing}}. It
        is constructed from a full or partial {{ThingDescription}} object.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
         Note that an existing {{ThingDescription}} object can be optionally modified (for instance by adding or removing elements on its |properties|, |actions| and |events| internal properties) and the resulting object can used for constructing an
         {{ExposedThing}} object. This is the current way of adding and
         removing <a>Property</a>, <a>Action</a> and <a>Event</a> definitions, as illustrated in the <a href="#exposedthing-examples">examples</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        Before invoking <a href="#dom-exposedthing-expose">expose()</a>, the {{ExposedThing}} object does not serve any requests. This allows first constructing {{ExposedThing}} and then initialize its <a>Properties</a> and service handlers before starting serving requests.
      </p>
      <div>
        To construct an {{ExposedThing}} with the {{ThingDescription}}
        |td:ThingDescription|, run the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            If invoking this method is not allowed for the current scripting context for security reasons, [= exception/throw =] a {{SecurityError}} and abort these steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Run the <a>expand a TD</a> steps on |td|. If that fails, re-[= exception/throw =] the error and abort these steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let |thing:ExposedThing| be a new {{ExposedThing}} object.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let ||td|| be an <a>internal slot</a> of |thing| and let |td| be its value.

      <h3>Methods inherited from {{ConsumedThing}}</h3>
      <p>
        The <code>readProperty()</code>, <code>readMultipleProperties()</code>, <code>readAllProperties()</code>, <code>writeProperty()</code>, <code>writeMultipleProperties()</code>, <code>writeAllProperties()</code> methods have the same algorithmic steps as described in <a href="#the-consumedthing-interface"><code>ConsumedThing</code></a>, with the difference that making a request to the underlying platform MAY be implemented with local methods or libraries and don't necessarily need to involve network operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implementation of {{ConsumedThing}} interface in an {{ExposedThing}} provide the <i>default</i> methods to interact with the {{ExposedThing}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        After constructing an {{ExposedThing}}, a script can initialize its <a>Properties</a> and can set up the optional read, write and action request handlers (the default ones are provided by the implementation). The script provided handlers MAY use the default handlers, thereby extending the default behavior, but they can also bypass them, overriding the default behavior. Finally, the script would call <a href="#the-expose-method"><code>expose()</code></a> on the {{ExposedThing}} in order to start serving external requests.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        The request handlers actually implement the behavior and it is the
        responsibility of the developers to keep the <a>Thing Description</a>
        defined in {{ExposedThing}} synchronized with the implementation of the
        request handlers.

      <h3>The <dfn>PropertyReadHandler</dfn> callback</h3>
      <p>
        A function that is called when an external request for reading a
        <a>Property</a> is received and defines what to do with such requests.
        It returns a {{Promise}} and resolves with an {{ReadableStream}} object or an
        <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/11.0/index.html#sec-ecmascript-data-types-and-values">
        ECMAScript value</a> conforming to <a>DataSchema</a>, or rejects with an

    <section> <h3>The <dfn>setPropertyReadHandler()</dfn> method</h3>

        Returns a reference to |this| object for supporting chaining.

        Note that there is no need to register handlers for handling requests

        may implement them using multiple calls to the single read handler.

      <p>
         The |handler| callback function should implement reading a <a>Property</a> and SHOULD be called by implementations when a request for reading a <a>Property</a> is received from the underlying platform.

        There MUST be at most one handler for any given <a>Property</a>, so newly added handlers MUST replace the previous handlers.

    <h2>The <dfn>ThingDiscovery</dfn> interface</h2>
    <p>
      Discovery is a distributed application that requires provisioning and support from participating network nodes (clients, servers, directory services). This API models the client side of typical discovery schemes supported by various IoT deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The {{ThingDiscovery}} object is constructed given a filter and provides the properties and methods controlling the discovery process.
    </p>
    <pre class="idl">
      [SecureContext, Exposed=(Window,Worker)]
      interface ThingDiscovery {
        constructor(optional ThingFilter filter = null);
        readonly attribute ThingFilter? filter;
        readonly attribute boolean active;
        readonly attribute boolean done;
        readonly attribute Error? error;
        void start();
        Promise&lt;ThingDescription&gt; next();
        void stop();
      };
    </pre>
    <p class="ednote">
      The {{ThingDiscovery}} interface has a <code>next()</code> method and a <code>done</code> property, but it is not an <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-async-iteration/">Iterable</a>. Look into <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api/issues/177">Issue 177</a> for rationale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>discovery results</dfn> <a>internal slot</a> is an internal queue for temporarily storing the found {{ThingDescription}} objects until they are consumed by the application using the <a href="#the-next-method">next()</a> method. Implementations MAY optimize the size of this queue based on e.g. the available resources and the frequency of invoking the <a href="#the-next-method">next()</a> method.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>filter</dfn> property represents the discovery filter of type <a>ThingFilter</a> specified for the discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>active</dfn> property is `true` when the discovery is actively ongoing on protocol level (i.e. new <a>TD</a>s may still arrive) and `false` otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>done</dfn> property is `true` if the discovery has been completed with no more results to report and <a>discovery results</a> is also empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <dfn>error</dfn> property represents the last error that occured during the discovery process. Typically used for critical errors that stop discovery.

    <section><h3>Constructing {{ThingDiscovery}}</h3>
      <div>
        To create {{ThingDiscovery}} with a |filter:ThingFilter| or type {{ThingFilter}}, run the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            If |filter| is not an object or `null`, [= exception/throw =] a {{TypeError}} and abort these steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let |discovery:ThingDiscovery| be a new {{ThingDiscovery}} object.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-filter">filter</a> property to |filter|.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> and <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-done">done</a> properties to `false`. Set the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-error">error</a> property to `null`.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return |discovery|.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        The <a href="#the-start-method">start()</a> method sets <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> to `true`. The <a href="the-stop-method">stop()</a> method sets the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> property to |false|, but <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-done">done</a> may be still `false` if there are {{ThingDescription}} objects in the <a>discovery results</a> not yet consumed with <a href="#the-next-method">next()</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
         During successive calls of <a href="#the-next-method">next()</a>, the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> property may be `true` or `false`, but the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-done">done</a> property is set to `false` by <a href="#the-next-method">next()</a> only when both the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> property is `false` and <a>discovery results</a> is empty.

            If discovery is not supported by the implementation, set the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-error">error</a> property to {{NotSupportedError}} and abort these steps.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let |filter| denote the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-filter">filter</a> property.

          <li>
            If the |filter| is defined,

              <li>
                If |filter|'s <a href="#dom-thingfilter-query">|query|</a> is defined, pass it as an opaque string to the underlying implementation to be matched against discovered items. The underlying implementation is responsible to parse it e.g. as a SPARQL or JSON query and match it against the <a>Thing Description</a>s found during the discovery process. If queries are not supported, set |this.error| to {{NotSupportedError}} and abort these steps.
              </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            Request the underlying platform to start the discovery process, with the following parameters:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If |filter|s <a href="#dom-thingfilter-method">|method|</a> is not defined or the value is `"any"`, use the widest discovery method supported by the underlying platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise if |filter|s <a href="#dom-thingfilter-method">|method|</a> is `"local"`, use the local <a>Thing Directory</a> for discovery. Usually that defines <a>Thing</a>s deployed in the same device, or connected to the device in slave mode (e.g. sensors connected via Bluetooth or a serial connection).
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise if |filter|s <a href="#dom-thingfilter-method">|method|</a> is `"directory"`, use the remote <a>Thing Directory</a> specified in |filter.url|.
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise if |filter|s <a href="#dom-thingfilter-method">|method|</a> is `"multicast"`, use all the multicast discovery protocols supported by the underlying platform.

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            When the underlying platform has started the discovery process, set the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> property to `true`.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whenever a new <a>Thing Description</a> |td:ThingDescription| is discovered by the underlying platform, run the following sub-steps:

                <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api">Fetch</a> |td| as a JSON object |json|. If that fails, set the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-error">error</a> property to {{SyntaxError}}, discard |td| and continue the discovery process.
              </li>
              <li>
                If |filter|'s <a href="#dom-thingfilter-query">|query|</a> is defined, check if |json| is a match for the query. The matching algorithm is encapsulated by implementations. If that returns `false`, discard |td| and continue the discovery process.
              </li>
              <li>
                If |filter|'s <a href="#dom-thingfilter-fragment">|fragment|</a> is defined, for each property defined in it, check if that property exists in |json|'s properties and has the same value. If this is `false` in any checks, discard |td| and continue the discovery process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Otherwise add |td| to the <a>discovery results</a>.
              </li>
              <li>
                At this point implementations MAY control the flow of the discovery process (depending on memory constraints, for instance temporarily stop discovery if the queue is getting too large, or resume discovery when the queue is emptied sufficiently).
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Whenever an error occurs during the discovery process,
            <ol>
              <li>
                Let |error| be a new {{Error}} object. Set |error|'s |name| to `"DiscoveryError"`.
              </li>
              <li>
                 If there was an error code or message provided by the <a>Protocol Bindings</a>, set |error|'s |message| to that value as string.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-error">error</a> property to |error|.

      <h3>The <dfn>next()</dfn> method</h3>
      <div>
        Provides the next discovered {{ThingDescription}} object. The method MUST run the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Return a {{Promise}} |promise:Promise| and execute the next steps <a>in parallel</a>.
          </li>

            If the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> property is `true`, wait until the <a>discovery results</a> <a>internal slot</a> is not empty.
          </li>
          <li>
            If <a>discovery results</a> is empty and the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> property is `false`, set the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-done">done</a> property to `true` and reject |promise|.

      <div>
        Stops or suppresses the discovery process. It might not be supported by all discovery methods and endpoints, however, any further discovery results or errors will be discarded and the discovery is marked inactive. The method MUST run the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Request the underlying platform to stop the discovery process. If this returns an error, or if it is not possible, for instance when discovery is based on open ended multicast requests, the implementation SHOULD discard subsequent discovered items.
          </li>
          <li>
            Set the <a href="#dom-thingdiscovery-active">active</a> property to `false`.

      <h3>Discovery Examples</h3>
      <p>
        The following example finds {{ThingDescription}} objects of <a>Thing</a>s that are exposed by local hardware, regardless how many instances of <a>WoT Runtime</a> it is running. Note that the discovery can end (become inactive) before the internal <a>discovery results</a> queue is emptied, so we need to continue reading {{ThingDescription}} objects until done. This is typical with local and directory type discoveries.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="Discover Things exposed by local hardware">
        let discovery = new ThingDiscovery({ method: "local" });
        do {
          let td = await discovery.next();
          console.log("Found Thing Description for " + td.title);
          let thing = new ConsumedThing(td);
          console.log("Thing name: " + thing.getThingDescription().title);
        } while (!discovery.done);
      </pre>
      <p>
        The next example finds {{ThingDescription}} objects of <a>Thing</a>s listed in a <a>Thing Directory</a> service. We set a timeout for safety.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="Discover Things via directory">
        let discoveryFilter = {
          method: "directory",
          url: "http://directory.wotservice.org"
        };
        let discovery = new ThingDiscovery(discoveryFilter);
        setTimeout( () => {
            discovery.stop();
            console.log("Discovery stopped after timeout.");
          },
          3000);
        do {
          let td = await discovery.next();
          console.log("Found Thing Description for " + td.title);
          let thing = new ConsumedThing(td);
          console.log("Thing name: " + thing.getThingDescription().title);
        } while (!discovery.done);
        if (discovery.error) {
          console.log("Discovery stopped because of an error: " + error.message);
        }
      </pre>
      <p>
        The next example is for an open-ended multicast discovery, which likely won't complete soon (depending on the underlying protocol), so stopping it with a timeout is a good idea. It will likely deliver results one by one.
      </p>
      <pre class="example" title="Discover Things in a network">
        let discovery = new ThingDiscovery({ method: "multicast" });
        setTimeout( () => {
            discovery.stop();
            console.log("Stopped open-ended discovery");
          },
          10000);
        do {
          let td = await discovery.next();
          let thing = new ConsumedThing(td);
          console.log("Thing name: " + thing.getThingDescription().title);
        } while (!discovery.done);

      A detailed discussion of security and privacy considerations for the Web of Things, including a threat model that can be adapted to various circumstances, is
      presented in the informative document [[!WOT-SECURITY-GUIDELINES]].
      This section discusses only security and privacy risks and possible mitigations
      directly relevant to the scripts and WoT Scripting API.
    </p>
    <p>
      A suggested set of best practices to improve security for WoT devices and
      services has been documented in [[!WOT-SECURITY-BEST-PRACTICES]].
      That document may be updated as security measures evolve.
      Following these practices does not guarantee security,
      but it might help avoid common known vulnerabilities.
    </p>
    <div>
      The WoT security risks and possible mitigations are concerning the following groups:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implementors of WoT Runtimes that do not implement a Scripting Runtime.
          The [[!WOT-ARCHITECTURE]] document provides generic security guidelines
          for this group.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementors of the WoT Scripting API in a WoT Scripting Runtime. This is the main scope and is covered in the
          <a href="#sec-security-consideration-runtime">
          Scripting Runtime Security and Privacy Risks</a> sub-section that
          contains normative text regarding security.
        </li>
        <li>
          WoT script developers, covered in the

      <section id="sec-security-consideration-input">
        <h3>Corrupted Input Security and Privacy Risk</h3>
        <p>
          A typical way to compromise any process is to send it a corrupted input
          via one of the exposed interfaces. This can be done to a script instance
          using WoT interface it exposes.
        </p>
        <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          Implementors of this API SHOULD perform validation on all script inputs. In addition to input validation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzzing</a> should be used to verify that the input processing is done correctly. There are many tools and techniques in existence to do such validation. More details can be found in [[!WOT-SECURITY-TESTING]].

      <section id="sec-security-consideration-device-direct-access">
        <h3>Physical Device Direct Access Security and Privacy Risk</h3>
        <p>
          In case a script is compromised or misbehaving, the underlying physical device (and potentially surrounded environment) can be damaged if a script can use directly exposed native device interfaces. If such interfaces lack safety checks on their inputs, they might bring the underlying physical device (or environment) to an unsafe state (i.e. device overheats and explodes).
        </p>
        <dl><dt>Mitigation:</dt><dd>
          The WoT Scripting Runtime SHOULD avoid directly exposing the native device interfaces to the script developers. Instead, a WoT Scripting Runtime should provide a hardware abstraction layer for accessing the native device interfaces. Such hardware abstraction layer should refuse to execute commands that might put the device (or environment) to an unsafe state.
          Additionally, in order to reduce the damage to a physical WoT device in cases a script gets compromised, it is important to minimize the number of interfaces that are exposed or accessible to a particular script based on its functionality.

      <section id="sec-security-consideration-update-provisioning">
        <h3>Provisioning and Update Security Risk</h3>

          If the WoT Scripting Runtime supports post-manufacturing provisioning
          or updates of scripts, WoT Scripting Runtime or any related data
          (including security credentials), it can be a major attack vector.

        <p>
          Typically the WoT Scripting Runtime needs to store the security credentials that are provisioned to a WoT device to operate in WoT network. If an attacker can compromise the confidentiality or integrity of these credentials, then it can obtain access to the WoT assets, impersonate WoT things or devices or create Denial-Of-Service (DoS) attacks.
        </p>

          The WoT Scripting Runtime should securely store the provisioned security credentials, guaranteeing their integrity and confidentiality.
          In case there are more than one tenant on a single WoT-enabled device, a WoT Scripting Runtime should guarantee isolation of each tenant provisioned security credentials.
          Additionally, in order to minimize a risk that provisioned security credentials get compromised, the WoT Scripting Runtime should not expose any API for scripts to query the provisioned security credentials.

  <section class="appendix">
    <h2>API design rationale</h2>
    <p>
      API rationale usually belongs to a separate document, but in the WoT case
      the complexity of the context justifies including basic rationale here.
    </p>
    <section> <h3>Approaches to WoT application development</h3>
      <p>
        The WoT Interest Group and Working Group have explored different
        approaches to application development for WoT that have been all
        implemented and tested.
      </p>
      <section> <h3>No Scripting API</h3>
        <p>
          It is possible to develop WoT applications that only use the
          <a>WoT network interface</a>, typically exposed by a WoT gateway that
          presents a REST-ful API towards clients and implements IoT protocol
          plugins that communicate with supported IoT deployments. One such
          implementation is the
          <a href="https://iot.mozilla.org/">Mozilla WebThings</a> platform.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section> <h3>Simple Scripting API</h3>
        <p>
          WoT <a>Thing</a>s show good synergy with software objects, so a
          <a>Thing</a> can be represented as a software object, with <a>Properties</a> represented as object properties, <a>Action</a>s as methods, and
          <a>Event</a>s as events. In addition, metadata is stored in special
          properties. Consuming and exposing is done with factory methods that
          produce a software object that directly represents a remote <a>Thing</a>
          and its interactions. One such implementation is the
          <a href="https://github.com/draggett/arena-webhub">Arena Web Hub</a>
          project.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next example, a <a>Thing</a> that represents interactions with
          a lock would look like the following: the |status| property
          and the <code>open()</code> method are directly exposed on the object.
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Open a lock with a simple API">
          let lock = await WoT.consume(‘https://td.my.com/lock-00123’);
          console.log(lock.status);
          lock.open('withThisKey');
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section> <h3>This API, aligned with [[WOT-TD]]</h3>
        <p>
          Since the direct mapping of <a>Thing</a>s to software objects have had
          some challenges, this specification takes another approach that
          exposes software objects to represent the <a>Thing</a> metadata as
          data property and the WoT interactions as methods. One implementation
          is <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/thingweb.node-wot">node-wot</a>
          in the the <a href="http://www.thingweb.io/">Eclipse ThingWeb</a> project,
          which is the current reference implementation of the API specified in
          this document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The same example now would look like the following: the
          |status| property and the <code>open()</code> method are
          represented indirectly.
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Open a lock">
          let res = await fetch(‘https://td.my.com/lock-00123’);
          let td = await res.json();
          let lock = new ConsumedThing(td);
          console.log(lock.readProperty(‘status’));
          lock.invokeAction(‘open’, 'withThisKey');
        </pre>
      </section>
      <p>
        In conclusion, the WoT WG decided to explore the third option that
        closely follows the [[WOT-TD]] specification. Based on this, a simple
        API can also be implemented.
        Since Scripting is an optional module in WoT, this leaves room for
        applications that only use the WoT network interface.
        Therefore all three approaches above are supported by [[WOT-TD]].
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the WoT network interface can be implemented in many languages
        and runtimes. Consider this API an example for what needs to be taken
        into consideration when designing a Scripting API for WoT.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Fetching and validating a TD</h4>
      <p>
        The <code>fetch(url)</code> method has been part of this API in earlier versions. However, now fetching a <a>TD</a> given a URL should be done with an external method, such as the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#fetch-api">Fetch API</a> or a HTTP client library, which offer already standardized options on specifying fetch details. The reason is that while simple fetch operations (covering most use cases) could be done in this API, when various fetch options were needed, there was no point in duplicating existing work to re-expose those options in this API.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since fetching a <a>TD</a> has been scoped out, and <a>TD</a> validation
        is defined externally in [[WOT-TD]], that is scoped out, too. This specification expects a <a>TD</a> as
        <a href="https://infra.spec.whatwg.org/#parse-json-from-bytes">parsed JSON object</a> that has been validated according to the [[WOT-TD]] specification.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Factory vs constructors</h4>
      <p>
        The factory methods for consuming and exposing <a>Thing</a>s are asynchronous and fully validate the input <a>TD</a>. In addition, one can also construct {{ConsumedThing}} and {{ExposedThing}} by providing a parsed and validated <a>TD</a>. Platform initialization is then done when needed during the WoT interactions. So applications that prefer validating a <a>TD</a> themselves, may use the constructors, whereas applications that leave validation to implementations and prefer interactions initialized up front SHOULD use the factory methods on the <a>WoT API object</a>.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Observers</h4>
      <p>
        Earlier drafts used the
        <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-observable">Observer</a>
        construct, but since it has not become standard, a new design was needed
        that was light enough for embedded implementations. Therefore observing
        <a>Property</a> changes and handling WoT <a>Event</a>s is done with
        callback registrations.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Using Events</h4>
      <div>
        This API ended up not using software events at all, for the following
        reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Subscription to WoT <a>Event</a>s may be different from handling software events (subscription might need parameters, might involve security tokens etc).
          </li>
          <li>
            Most implementations are for Node.js and browser implementations will likely be libraries (because possible dependency management issues in native implementations), using Events has been challenging.
          </li>
          <li>
            Observing <a>Property</a> changes and handling WoT <a>Event</a>s is done with the solution above.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section> <h4>Polymorphic functions</h4>
      <p>
        The reason to use function names like <code>readProperty()</code>, <code>readMultipleProperties()</code> etc. instead of a generic polymorphic <code>read()</code> function is that the current names map exactly to the <code>"op"</code> vocabulary from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2019/CR-wot-thing-description-20190516/#form">Form</a> definition in [[WOT-TD]].
